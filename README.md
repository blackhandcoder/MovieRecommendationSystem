# MovieRecommendationSystem
The Movie Recommendation System is a Streamlit-based web app that suggests movies similar to a selected title using cosine similarity. It uses a precomputed similarity matrix based on movie metadata like genres, cast, and keywords, and dynamically fetches movie posters from the TMDB API for a better user experience.
